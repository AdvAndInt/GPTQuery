# GPTQuery
I've been working on an text based RPG using ChatGPT and I needed an easy to use GPT Interface, thus this script was born. It's quite usable, but needs a lot of polish that I'm not really focused on right now. I'm hoping someone can at least find this useful to start working with ChatGPT in Godot.
